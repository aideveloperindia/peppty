Peppty Technologies Website Refresh

Summary
The site now reflects a formal, globally credible corporate presence. Animated hero sequences, custom cursors, and glassmorphism have been removed in favour of static layouts, disciplined typography, and consistent red-on-white accents.

Key Changes
- Standard browser cursor, no motion-driven elements.
- Fixed white navigation with red hover state, simplified mobile menu.
- Static hero with clear messaging and a single, high-quality ecosystem image.
- Product, team, and timeline sections rebuilt as structured cards with subtle shadows only.
- Contact form redesigned with neutral panels, clear labels, and straight-forward success messaging.
- Dark corporate footer with red link accents and company details.

Technical Notes
- Removed framer-motion, custom cursor component, and related utility styles.
- Replaced motion-driven helper components with static equivalents.
- Updated global styles to focus on typography, colour tokens, and accessibility.
- Excluded legacy "version 1" folder from TypeScript compilation to keep builds clean.
- Verified production build via npm run build.

Next Steps
- Swap placeholder copy and imagery with final corporate-approved assets.
- Connect the contact form to the production email/CRM workflow.
- Capture Lighthouse reports (desktop and mobile) after deployment.
