# Complete Guide: Deploy Peppty Technologies Website to GoDaddy

## Prerequisites
- GoDaddy hosting account (with cPanel or File Manager access)
- Domain name configured
- Node.js installed on your local machine

---

## Step 1: Build the Static Export Locally

### 1.1 Open Terminal/Command Prompt
Navigate to your project directory:
```bash
cd C:\Users\DELL\pepptywebsite
```

### 1.2 Install Dependencies (if not already done)
```bash
npm install
```

### 1.3 Build the Static Export
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an `out/` folder containing all static files.

### 1.4 Verify the Build
- Check that `out/` folder exists
- Inside `out/`, you should see:
  - `index.html`
  - `products/`, `about/`, `legal/`, etc. folders
  - `_next/` folder (static assets)
  - `peppty-logo.png`, `favicon.png`, etc.

---

## Step 2: Access GoDaddy Hosting

### Option A: Using cPanel (Recommended)
1. Log in to your GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" → "Web Hosting" → "Manage"
3. Click on "cPanel"
4. Open "File Manager"

### Option B: Using FTP
1. Get FTP credentials from GoDaddy
2. Use FileZilla or another FTP client
3. Connect using:
   - Host: `ftp.yourdomain.com` (or IP provided by GoDaddy)
   - Username: (provided by GoDaddy)
   - Password: (provided by GoDaddy)
   - Port: 21

---

## Step 3: Prepare GoDaddy Hosting

### 3.1 Locate Root Directory
- In cPanel File Manager: Look for `public_html/` folder (or `httpdocs/`)
- In FTP: Navigate to the same folder

### 3.2 Backup Existing Files (if any)
- If you have existing files, create a backup folder
- Move existing files to backup folder

### 3.3 Clear Root Directory
- Delete all files in `public_html/` (keep the folder itself)
- Do NOT delete `.htaccess` if it exists (we'll recreate it)

---

## Step 4: Upload Files to GoDaddy

### Option A: Using cPanel File Manager
1. Open File Manager in cPanel
2. Navigate to `public_html/` folder
3. Click "Upload" button
4. Select all files from your local `out/` folder
5. Upload all files (this may take a few minutes)

### Option B: Using FTP
1. Connect via FTP client
2. Navigate to `public_html/` folder
3. Upload all contents from your local `out/` folder:
   - Drag and drop all folders and files
   - Maintain the folder structure
   - Make sure `_next/` folder is uploaded completely

---

## Step 5: Create/Update .htaccess File

### 5.1 Create .htaccess File
Create a new file named `.htaccess` in your `public_html/` folder with the following content:

```apache
# Enable Rewrite Engine
RewriteEngine On

# Handle Next.js routing - redirect all requests to index.html except files
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [L]

# Security Headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
  Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
  Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
</IfModule>

# Enable Compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/json
</IfModule>

# Cache Control
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/webp "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 month"
  ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 month"
</IfModule>

# Prevent directory listing
Options -Indexes
```

### 5.2 Upload .htaccess File
- Upload the `.htaccess` file to `public_html/`
- Make sure it's named exactly `.htaccess` (no extension)

---

## Step 6: Verify File Structure

Your `public_html/` folder should now contain:
```
public_html/
├── .htaccess
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── products/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── chat.html
│   ├── peppty.html
│   └── ...
├── legal/
│   ├── privacy.html
│   ├── ip.html
│   └── ...
├── _next/
│   └── (static assets)
├── peppty-logo.png
├── favicon.png
├── robots.txt
├── sitemap.xml
└── (other static files)
```

---

## Step 7: Test Your Website

### 7.1 Visit Your Domain
- Open your browser and visit: `https://yourdomain.com`
- Test all pages:
  - Homepage
  - Products page
  - About page
  - Contact form (should open Gmail)

### 7.2 Check for Issues
- Broken images → Check image paths
- 404 errors → Check .htaccess routing
- CSS not loading → Check _next folder upload

---

## Step 8: Domain and SSL Configuration

### 8.1 Domain Pointing
- Ensure your domain DNS is pointing to GoDaddy hosting
- A record: `@` → Your hosting IP
- CNAME: `www` → `@`

### 8.2 SSL Certificate
- In cPanel, find "SSL/TLS Status"
- Install Let's Encrypt SSL certificate (free)
- Force HTTPS redirect

---

## Step 9: Update Contact Form (if needed)

Your contact form now opens Gmail, which works perfectly with static hosting. If you want server-side handling later:
- Use a third-party service (Formspree, Netlify Forms)
- Or use GoDaddy email forwarding

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: 404 errors on page navigation
**Solution:** Make sure `.htaccess` file is uploaded and RewriteEngine is enabled

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution:** Check that image paths in `public/` folder are uploaded correctly

### Issue: CSS/styles not working
**Solution:** Verify `_next/static/` folder uploaded completely

### Issue: Contact form not working
**Solution:** Your form opens Gmail, which works. If you need server-side, use third-party service

### Issue: Slow loading
**Solution:** Enable compression in .htaccess (already included above)

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Build static export
npm run build

# The output will be in: out/
# Upload everything from out/ to: public_html/
```

---

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Contact form opens Gmail
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] SSL certificate installed
- [ ] robots.txt accessible
- [ ] sitemap.xml accessible

---

## Important Notes

1. **Static Export:** Your site is fully static, so API routes won't work. Your contact form opens Gmail, which is perfect for static hosting.

2. **Updates:** When you make changes:
   - Run `npm run build` locally
   - Upload new files from `out/` to `public_html/`

3. **Performance:** Static hosting is fast and perfect for your corporate website.

---

## File Permissions

Set correct permissions in cPanel File Manager:
- Files: 644
- Folders: 755
- .htaccess: 644

---

## DNS Configuration Details

### A Record
- Type: A
- Name: @
- Value: Your GoDaddy hosting IP address
- TTL: 600 seconds (or default)

### CNAME Record
- Type: CNAME
- Name: www
- Value: @
- TTL: 600 seconds (or default)

---

## SSL Certificate Setup

1. Log in to GoDaddy cPanel
2. Navigate to "SSL/TLS Status"
3. Click "Run AutoSSL" or "Install SSL"
4. Select your domain
5. Choose "Let's Encrypt" (free)
6. Click "Install"
7. Wait for installation (usually 5-10 minutes)
8. Enable "Force HTTPS Redirect" in cPanel

---

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Enable Gzip Compression:** Already included in .htaccess
2. **Browser Caching:** Already configured in .htaccess
3. **Image Optimization:** Images are already optimized by Next.js
4. **CDN:** Consider using Cloudflare CDN for better global performance

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep .htaccess Updated:** The provided .htaccess includes security headers
2. **Regular Backups:** Backup your `out/` folder before each deployment
3. **Update Dependencies:** Regularly run `npm update` and rebuild
4. **Monitor Logs:** Check GoDaddy error logs regularly

---

## Making Updates to Your Website

### Process for Updates:
1. Make changes to your code locally
2. Test locally: `npm run dev`
3. Build static export: `npm run build`
4. Upload new files from `out/` to `public_html/`
5. Clear browser cache and test

### What to Upload:
- Only upload changed files (faster)
- Or upload entire `out/` folder (safer, recommended)

---

## Contact Form Alternative Solutions

Since your contact form opens Gmail, it works perfectly. If you need server-side processing:

### Option 1: Formspree
- Sign up at formspree.io
- Get form endpoint
- Update contact form to POST to Formspree endpoint

### Option 2: Netlify Forms
- Not applicable for GoDaddy hosting

### Option 3: EmailJS
- Sign up at emailjs.com
- Configure email service
- Update contact form JavaScript

### Option 4: GoDaddy Email Forwarding
- Set up email forwarding in cPanel
- Use mailto: links (current implementation)

---

## Backup Strategy

### Before Each Deployment:
1. Backup current `out/` folder locally
2. Download current `public_html/` from GoDaddy
3. Keep version history

### Backup Commands:
```bash
# Create backup folder
mkdir backups
mkdir backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Copy out folder
cp -r out backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

---

<body>
  <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
  <p>The page you're looking for doesn't exist.</p>
  <a href="/">Go Home</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Redirects:
Add to .htaccess:
```apache
# Redirect old page to new page
Redirect 301 /old-page.html /new-page.html
```
